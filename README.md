Step 1: The homepage has a navigation bar with options for Login and Signup.

Step 2: Users must first register through the Signup process before they can log in to the system.

Step 3: Once successfully authenticated, users can access additional navigation items, such as Transfer and Report Generate.

Step 4: In the Transfer section, there is a simple form where users can fill in details to transfer money from a source to a destination account.

Step 5: After completing a transfer, the user can view transaction reports in the Report section. A date filter is applied here, and if data exists within the selected date range, the transaction details are displayed in a list.

Step 6: The logout functionality has not been implemented yet, as I focused on completing the required tasks first.
